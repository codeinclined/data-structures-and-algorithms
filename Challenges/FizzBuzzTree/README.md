# FizzBuzz Tree

This challenge involves taking a binary tree containing string representations
of integers and performing the FizzBuzz tests on those strings after
converting them to integers. If these numbers are divisible by three, then the
node's value is changed to "Fizz". If they are divisible by 5 then the node's
value is changed to "Buzz". If the numbers are divisible by 3 _and_ 5, then
the node's value is changed to "FizzBuzz". A demonstration method is provided
in the Program class' Main method as well as three test cases tested via
an xUnit Theory.

## Challenge

- Write a function called FizzBuzzTree which takes a tree as an argument.
- Without utilizing any of the built-in methods available to your language,
determine whether or not the value of each node is divisible by 3, 5, or both,
and change the value of each of the nodes respectively.
- Return the tree with its new values.
