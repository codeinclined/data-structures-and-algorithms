# Find All Matches

This challenge involves finding __all__ nodes within a given k-ary tree and
returning them to the caller in the form of a collection. The chosen
implementation makes use of breadth-first traversal, comparing each node in
the tree against the search value. Provided trees can contain any number of
duplicate values.

## Challenge

- [X] Write a function that takes a k-ary tree with non-unique values and a target value.
- [X] Return a collection of all the nodes from within the tree that match the provided value.
- [X] Avoid utilizing any of the built-in methods available to your language.

## Solution

O(n) for space and time complexity.
